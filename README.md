# Data-Analysis
A series of analysis and exploratory work on some of the less known data available on the net.
The goal is to visualise these data and pick up patters and stories from the data.
I will be using Python for this analysis and visualisations.
Some of the maps and map charts will come in html format for improved appearance.
